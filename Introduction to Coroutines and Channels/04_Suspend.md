# Using suspend functions

Retrofit provides native support for coroutines, and we're going to use it.
Instead of returning `Call<List<Repo>>`, we now define our API call as a `suspend` function:

```kotlin
interface GitHubService {
    @GET("orgs/{org}/repos?per_page=100")
    suspend fun getOrgRepos(
        @Path("org") org: String
    ): List<Repo>
}
```

The main idea behind it is that when we use a `suspend` function to perform a request, the underlying thread isn't blocked.
We'll discuss how exactly it works a bit later. 

Note that now `getOrgRepos` returns the result directly instead of returning a `Call`.
If the result is unsuccessful, an exception is thrown.

Alternatively, Retrofit also allows returning the result wrapped in `Response`.
In this case, the result body is provided and it is possible to manually check for errors.
We'll use the `Response` versions in this tutorial. 

Please add the following declarations to `GitHubService`:

```kotlin
interface GitHubService {
    // getOrgReposCall & getRepoContributorsCall declarations
    
    @GET("orgs/{org}/repos?per_page=100")
    suspend fun getOrgRepos(
        @Path("org") org: String
    ): Response<List<Repo>>

    @GET("repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors?per_page=100")
    suspend fun getRepoContributors(
        @Path("owner") owner: String,
        @Path("repo") repo: String
    ): Response<List<User>>
}
```

The task is to change the code of the function loading contributors to make use of these new `suspend` functions.
 
A `suspend` function can't be called everywhere,
if it is called from `loadContributorsBlocking`, there will be an error:
"Suspend function 'getOrgRepos' should only be called from a coroutine or another suspend function".
So, we need to mark our new version of the `loadContributors` function as `suspend` in order to use this new API.

Please now do the following task, and right after that we'll discuss how `suspend` functions work and how
they are different from regular ones.
We'll also see how to call a `suspend` function from a non-suspending one.

#### Task

Copy the implementation of `loadContributorsBlocking` (defined in `src/tasks/Request1Blocking.kt`)
into `loadContributorsSuspend` (defined in `src/tasks/Request4Suspend.kt`).
Then modify it in a way so that the new suspend functions are used instead of ones returning `Call`s.
Run the program choosing the `SUSPEND` option and make sure that the UI is still responsive while the GitHub requests are performed. 

#### Solution

Modifying the code is straightforward.
Just replace `.getOrgReposCall(req.org).execute()` with `.getOrgRepos(req.org)`
and repeat the same replacement for the second "contributors" request.
That's it!
Everything else stays the same: 

```kotlin
suspend fun loadContributorsSuspend(service: GitHubService, req: RequestData): List<User> {
    val repos = service
        .getOrgRepos(req.org)
        .also { logRepos(req, it) }
        .bodyList()

    return repos.flatMap { repo ->
        service.getRepoContributors(req.org, repo.name)
            .also { logUsers(repo, it) }
            .bodyList()
    }.aggregate()
}
```

Note that `loadContributorsSuspend` should be defined as a `suspend` function.

We no longer need to call `execute` which returned the `Response` before, because now the API functions return the `Response`
directly.
But that's an implementation detail specific to the Retrofit library.
With other libraries, the API will be different, but the concept is the same:

Our code with `suspend` functions looks surprisingly similar to the "blocking" version.
It's readable and expresses exactly what we're trying to achieve.

The major difference with a blocking version is that instead of blocking the thread, we suspend the coroutine:

```
block -> suspend
thread -> coroutine
```

Coroutines are often called light-weight threads.
That means we can run code on coroutines similar to how we run code on threads.
The operations that were blocking before (and had to be avoided because of that),
can now suspend the coroutine instead.

How can we start a new coroutine?
If we look at how we call `loadContributorsSuspend`, we can see that we call it inside `launch`.
`launch` is a library function that takes a lambda as an argument: 

```kotlin
launch {
    val users = loadContributorsSuspend(req)
    updateResults(users, startTime)
}
```

`launch` starts a new computation.
This computation is responsible for loading the data and showing the results.
This computation is suspendable: while performing the network requests, it gets "suspended"
and releases the underlying thread.
When the network request returns the result, the computation is resumed.

Such a suspendable computation is called a coroutine,
so, we'll simply say that in this case, `launch` _starts a new coroutine_ that is responsible
for loading data and showing the results.

Coroutines are computations that run on top of threads and can be suspended.
When a coroutine is "suspended", the corresponding computation is paused,
removed from the thread, and stored in memory.
Meanwhile, the thread is free to be occupied with other activities:

![](./assets/4-suspend/SuspensionProcess.gif)

When the computation is ready to be continued, it gets returned to a thread (but not necessarily to the same one). 

Let's return to our `loadContributorsSuspend` example.
Each "contributors" request now waits for the result via the suspension mechanism.
First, the new request is sent.
Then, while waiting for the response, the whole "load contributors" coroutine becomes suspended
(the one we've discussed above started by the `launch` function). 
The coroutine resumes only after the corresponding response is received:

![](./assets/4-suspend/SuspendRequests.png)

While the response is waiting to be received, the thread is free to be occupied with other tasks.
That's why when users are loaded via the `SUSPEND` option, the UI stays responsive, despite all the requests
taking place on the main UI thread.
The log confirms that all the requests are sent on the main UI thread:

```
2538 [AWT-EventQueue-0 @coroutine#1] INFO  Contributors - kotlin: loaded 30 repos
2729 [AWT-EventQueue-0 @coroutine#1] INFO  Contributors - ts2kt: loaded 11 contributors
3029 [AWT-EventQueue-0 @coroutine#1] INFO  Contributors - kotlin-koans: loaded 45 contributors
...
11252 [AWT-EventQueue-0 @coroutine#1] INFO  Contributors - kotlin-coroutines-workshop: loaded 1 contributors
```

The log can also show you what coroutine the corresponding code runs on.
To enable it, open `Run | Edit configurations...` and add the `-Dkotlinx.coroutines.debug` VM option:

![](./assets/4-suspend/RunConfiguration.png)

Then while running `main` with this option, the coroutine name will be attached to the thread name.
We can also modify the template for running all the Kotlin files and enable this option by default.

In our case, all the code runs on one coroutine,
the mentioned above "load contributors" coroutine, denoted as `@coroutine#1`.

In this version, while waiting for the result, we don't reuse the thread for sending other requests,
because we have written our code in a sequential way. The new request is sent only when the previous result is received.
`suspend` functions treat the thread fairly and don't block it for "waiting",
but it doesn't yet bring any concurrency to the picture. Let's see how this can be improved.
