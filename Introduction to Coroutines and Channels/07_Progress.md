# Showing progress

Despite the information for some repositories being loaded rather fast,
the user only sees the resulting list once all the data is loaded.
Until then, the loader icon runs showing the progress, but there's no information about the current state,
and what contributors are already loaded.  
We could show the intermediate results earlier and display all the contributors after loading the data
for each of the repositories:

![](./assets/7-progress/Loading.gif)

To implement this functionality, we'll need to pass logic updating the UI as a callback, so that it is called on
each intermediate state:

```kotlin
suspend fun loadContributorsProgress(
    service: GitHubService,
    req: RequestData,
    updateResults: suspend (List<User>, completed: Boolean) -> Unit
) {
    // loading the data
    // calling `updateResults` on intermediate states 
}
```

On the call site, we pass the callback updating the results from the `Main` thread: 

```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    loadContributorsProgress(service, req) { users, completed ->
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            updateResults(users, startTime, completed)
        }
    }
}
```

The `updateResults` parameter is declared as `suspend` in `loadContributorsProgress`.
We need that to call `withContext`, which is a `suspend` function inside the corresponding lambda argument.

`updateResults` callback takes an additional `Boolean` parameter as an argument saying whether 
all the loading completed and our results are final.

#### Task

Implement the function `loadContributorsProgress` that shows the intermediate progress (in the `Request6Progress.kt` file).
Base it on the `loadContributorsSuspend` function (from `Request4Suspend.kt`).
We'll use a simple version without concurrency; we'll discuss how to add concurrency to this solution in the next section. 

Note that the intermediate list of contributors should be shown in an "aggregated" state, not just the list of users
loaded for each repository.
The total numbers of contributions for each user should be increased when the data for each new repository is loaded. 

#### Solution

We need to store the intermediate list of loaded contributors in an "aggregated" state.
We can define an `allUsers` variable which stores the list of users, and then update it
after contributors for each new repository are loaded: 

```kotlin
suspend fun loadContributorsProgress(
    service: GitHubService,
    req: RequestData,
    updateResults: suspend (List<User>, completed: Boolean) -> Unit
) {
    val repos = service
        .getOrgRepos(req.org)
        .also { logRepos(req, it) }
        .bodyList()

    var allUsers = emptyList<User>()
    for ((index, repo) in repos.withIndex()) {
        val users = service.getRepoContributors(req.org, repo.name)
            .also { logUsers(repo, it) }
            .bodyList()

        allUsers = (allUsers + users).aggregate()
        updateResults(allUsers, index == repos.lastIndex)
    }
}
```

An `updateResults` callback is called after each request is completed:

We haven't used any concurrency so far. This code is sequential, so we don't need synchronization.

We'd like to send requests concurrently and update the intermediate results after getting the response
for each repository:

How do we add concurrency to this solution?
Channels solve that.
